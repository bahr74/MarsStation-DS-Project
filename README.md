# MarsStation-DS-Project
Data Structures project for simulating a Mars Station. Implements mission assignment, rover management, priority queues, ready lists, abort logic, and full day-by-day simulation 
# MarsStation DS Project

This repository contains the implementation of the “Space Exploration / Mars Station Simulation” 
Data Structures project. The project simulates mission scheduling, rover management, 
day-by-day simulation, abort logic, and output statistics.
